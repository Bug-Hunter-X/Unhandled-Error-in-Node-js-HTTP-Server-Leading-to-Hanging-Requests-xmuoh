# Unhandled Error in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js HTTP servers: failing to handle errors properly, leading to hanging requests.  The server simulates an asynchronous operation that may fail. If the operation fails, the error is logged, but the client receives no response, causing requests to hang indefinitely.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a server that simulates an asynchronous operation.  If the simulated operation fails, the server logs an error message but fails to send an appropriate response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error). This results in client requests hanging indefinitely.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. The improved version always sends a response to the client, even in case of errors.  It properly handles exceptions and sends error responses with appropriate status codes.
